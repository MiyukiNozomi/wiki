        <h2>Well, this is pretty much me: "Miyuki Nozomi".</h2>
        <p>I feel like it's going to be a horrible idea to simply reveal my
            personal information here, so i'll just retell what i had written on my ancient webite that
            i had with github pages (personally i still don't know why i changed it. since the old website was
            much better than the one before this one.)
        </p>
        <h1>Hello, my name is [REDACTED],<br> and i started programming for
            real in 2019.</h1>
        <p>
            The First Programming Language that i started learning was C++, and
            after 3 weeks i went into another language called BatchScript,<br>
            <br> After Batch, i then got in a language called C#, and well, i
            stayed in that language for just 3 days. (i had a really bad
            experince.)<br>
            <br> And, i was almost giving up about programming, when i found
            Java, java was special because it was the first language that i used
            for real. (you can see that by about 90% of my github repositories
            having java as a main language), <br>
            <br> after soo much time, i found D, which is a really good
            language.<br>
            <br> now in 2021, i got back into C++, and now its for real.<br>
            <br/>
            Well, that was written a year ago.<br/>
            No, i didn't go through with C++, Today i'm a HAXE, D, and Java programmer.
