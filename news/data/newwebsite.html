<p>Slightly more sophisticated, isn't it?<br/>
Just kidding, most of the UI code was taken from w3schools (thanks to them)
Of course, i've made a few modifications to fit a style that i've liked. so,
this webpage is the result.

<p>By the way, i should probably mention that this is a fully static website
so, yeah, this is technically all done in client-side which is pretty interesting!
its kinda fun to try to mimic something like a webforum without having a backend 
or really anything too userful.
